In this project I developed a simple Journal System.
I used Class, Object, Constructor,Getter/Setter, and Encapsulation.

Program uses the given corpus in order to list articles which belong to Authors. 
And with the articles.txt it completes Authors' articles.

There can be different commands to use such as:
completeAll
list
sortedAll
del 100
read "file.txt"
